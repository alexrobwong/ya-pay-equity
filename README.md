## Data 
Initial data extract was recieved from Lori Rivera on March 8th, 2021. These excel files have commited to this repo in the data folder - while generally not best practice, due the very small size of the files (143 KB total) they were commited to the repo for convenience. 

Within these reports, if the venue price and the artist fee are equal that would indicate a funded program.  This means there is no cost to the venue, the program is fully funded through a grant from an outside source.
